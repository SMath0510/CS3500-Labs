Experience:
The overall experience with the assignment was good. There were many ambiguities in the initial phase of coding the assignment, but the freedom to make assumptions and state them made it easier to go with the coding aspect.

Suggestions for change:
It was simple enough to implement, only if we get the initial idea on how to approach the problem. If we could keep a session 2-3 days before the deadline on how to approach the problem, then that would save a lot of time of the students.

The TAs were really helpful and solved our doubts on time.
